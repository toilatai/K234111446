  <h2 style="color:#c00; text-align:center">Doc-Centric Sales: Midwest Region</h2>
  <p>The Midwest region had another strong sales year with record-setting sales of both the
     M300-25 and M100-11 models. The only disappointment was the lackluster sales of the
     M300-15 model, which started the year strong but tapered off into the fourth quarter.
     All-in-all though, a very good year for the Midwest region.</p>
