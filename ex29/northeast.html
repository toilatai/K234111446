  <h2 style="color:#c00; text-align:center">Doc-Centric Sales: Northeast Region</h2>
  <p>The Northeast region had a mixed sales year last year. Some models like the C300-25
     performed admirably, while others like the C200-20 had disappointing years. We anticipate a
     stronger year in current year with the introduction of the C300-30 model - a great copier at
     a competitive price.</p>
