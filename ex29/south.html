  <h2 style="color:#0a0; text-align:center">Doc-Centric Sales: South Region</h2>
  <p>Sales in the Southern region were off last year as the economy entered a slight downturn.
     Sales of the M100-10 model suffered the largest decline - 15% under sales two years ago.
     The lone bright spot was the continuing strong sales of the M300-25 unit which increased as
     last year progressed.</p>
